The input file should follow the following format:

1. The first line should have two numbers separated by whitespace: 'w h'. 'w' represents the width of the area to be mapped, while 'h' represents the height of the area to be mapped. The unit used is an integer and has to be consistent with the units used for the magnitude of the vectors.

2. Each of the lines to follow should have 4 numbers: 'x y vx vy'. 'x y' represent the x and y coordinates of the vector with the origin at the bottom-left of the area defined in 1. 'vx vy' are the x and y components of the wind speed vector.
